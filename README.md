- Uses Radix UI components and Tailwind CSS for modern, accessible UI
- Integrates with Amazon Bedrock for advanced AI and LLM capabilities
- Includes an MCP (Main Control Plane) backend for core business logic and orchestration
- Features RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality for enhanced information retrieval and generation
- Integrates with OpenAI and Groq SDKs
- Utilities for PDF parsing and charting

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn

## Hosting Backend Services: MCP and Bedrock Instances

The project also requires backend services for full functionality. Specifically, you must run both the **MCP** (Main Control Plane) and **Bedrock** instances alongside the frontend.

### MCP (Main Control Plane)

- The MCP service coordinates and manages core business logic and backend integration.
- Make sure the MCP service is running and accessible to the frontend before launching the application.
- Refer to the `mcp/` directory (or relevant documentation) for setup instructions, dependencies, and how to start the MCP instance.

### Bedrock

- Bedrock provides foundational data services, advanced AI/LLM APIs, and RAG support required by the app.
- This service must also be running and accessible.
- Refer to the `bedrock/` directory (or relevant documentation) for detailed setup and launch instructions.

**Note:**  
Adjust environment variables or configuration files as needed to point the frontend to your running MCP and Bedrock services. Check `.env` files in each directory for configuration options.
